		"info": "The brain is divided into two sides called hemispheres. Each side controls different body functions. In most people, the left side of the brain controls language skills. Aphasia is damage to the language area from a stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI) or tumor. Aphasia can affect all forms of communication, including speaking, understanding, reading and writing. Not all language areas may be affected the same way. For example, one person with aphasia may find it easier to read than talk, while another may find it easier to write than read. Aphasia can be temporary or permanent.",

A person with non-fluent aphasia may sound hesitant while searching for the right word to say. It can be frustrating for the person affected because he or she usually understands better than he or she is able to express their ideas. Attempts to find the right word may or may not be successful. The person may only be able to speak in single words, short phrases or parts of sentences. Sometimes the person may not be able to talk. \\n\\nFluent Aphasia\\nA person with fluent aphasia does not have trouble talking or think there is a problem with word choice. However, the words spoken may be nonsense or real words that are used incorrectly. The person with fluent aphasia may be unaware that speech is not meaningful. It may lead to frustration and anger toward the listener for not understanding what he or she wants to say.",

For example, when asked the question \"What do you drive?\" the person may answer \"car\" and then continue to answer \"car\" for the next several responses. You may also hear the term \"perseveration\" to explain this behavior.\\n\\nNaming Problems\\nA person may have problems naming common objects that he/she sees.

If your blood pressure is high, work with your doctor to keep it under control.\\n   - Have your blood pressure checked at least one time each year and more often if you have a history of high blood pressure.\\n   - See your doctor if the higher number (your systolic blood pressure) is often over 120 or if the lower number (your diastolic blood pressure) is often over 80.\\n• Find out if you have atrial fibrillation, also called AF or atrial fib. If you have AF, work with your doctor to manage it.\\n   - Atrial fibrillation can cause blood to collect in the chambers of your heart. This blood can form clots and cause a stroke.\\n   - Your doctor can detect AF by carefully checking your pulse.\\n• If you smoke or use other tobacco products, stop. Smoking doubles the risk for stroke. If you stop smoking today, your risk for stroke will begin to decrease.\\n• If you drink alcohol, limit the amount.\\n   - Drinking up to two alcoholic drinks each day may lower your risk for stroke, provided that there is no other medical reason you should avoid alcohol.\\n   - Alcohol is a drug and it can interact with other drugs you are taking.\\n   - Alcohol is harmful if taken in large doses.\\n   - If you don't drink, don't start.\\n• Know your cholesterol number. If your level if over 200, work with your doctor to control it.\\n   - Lowering your cholesterol may reduce your risk for stroke.\\n   - High cholesterol can increase stroke risk by putting you at greater risk of heart disease. \\n   - Often high cholesterol can be controlled with diet and exercise but some people may need to take medicine.\\n• If you have diabetes, follow your doctor's recommendations to control your diabetes. Having diabetes puts you at an increased risk for stroke.\\n• Include exercise in your daily routine. A brisk walk, swim or other exercise activity for as little as 30 minutes a day can improve your health in many ways, and may reduce your risk for stroke.\\n• Eat a lower sodium (salt), lower fat diet. By cutting down on sodium and fat in your diet, you may be able to lower your blood pressure and your risk for stroke.\\n• Ask your doctor if you have circulation problems. If so, work with your doctor to control them.\\n   - Fatty deposits can block the arteries that carry blood from your heart to your brain. This kind of blockage can cause stroke.\\n   - Sickle cell disease, severe anemia, or other diseases can cause stroke if left untreated.\\n• Call 911 if you have any stroke signs:\\n   - Sudden numbness or weakness of face, arm or leg, often on just one side of the body\\n   - Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding\\n   - Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes\\n   - Sudden trouble walking\\n   - Sudden dizziness or loss of balance or coordination\\n   - Sudden severe headache with no known cause\\n\\nIf you have questions about your stroke risk, please ask your doctor or nurse.",
